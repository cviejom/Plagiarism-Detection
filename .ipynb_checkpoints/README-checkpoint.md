# Plagiarism Detection
### The Plagiarism detection model examines a text file and performs binary classification to determine if contents plagiarism base in an original file 
 
Plagiarism detection is the process of locating instances of plagiarism within a work or document. 
The widespread use of computers and the advent of the Internet has made it easier to plagiarize the work of others. Most cases of plagiarism are found in academia, where documents are typically essays or reports.
